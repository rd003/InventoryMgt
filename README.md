# Inventory management (Work in prgress)

An `inventory management` project with angular and .net core apis.

## When have I started it and feature upgrades?

- I have built this project in **early 2024** with `.net 8 ` and `angular 17`. I had created two separate github repositories for `front-end` and `backend`. Now, I have moved them to a single repository.
- I have upgraded it to `.NET 9` and `Angular 20`.
- I have used `sql server 2022` as a database. I have used `stored procedures` in all the places. I have taken a challange and migrated it to `PostgreSQL` to see how comfortable am I with Postgres without entity framework and what challanges we face during migrations. It was not easy but fun ride.
- I also have added feautres like `suppliers` and `authentication`.
- I have added `entity framework core` for future updates and specially for migrations. I use two machines back and forth and **it was hard to maintain both dev databases**. Entity framework migrations helped me with that. Howeverm I haven't used it anywhere yet. May be I will use it authentication feature (yeah, I am working on this feature).

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Asp.net core web api (9.0) (upgrade from .net 8)
- **Database:** Postgres (previously sql server 2022)
- **ORM:** Dapper(Most of the places), EF Core
- **Frontend:** Angular 20  (upgraded from v18)
- **UI:** Angular material (UI component library)
- **State Management:** `Ngrx componnent store` (Almost everywhere) and `service with signal` (For newer features).

## How to run the project in dev environment

- Make sure you have installed `dotnet 9` sdk,latest node js and angular cli.
- **Clone this project:** Open terminal and run `git clone https://github.com/rd003/InventroyMgt.git`
- `cd `
- With command `code .`, your project will be opened in VS Code.
- You need to run both projects separately:

### A. Backend

1. To work with this project, you must execute this [script](./database/db.sql) in your sql server database.
2. Open `appsettings.json` and configure the connection string according to your database.
3. Open `InventoryMgt.Api` in the integrated terminal.
4. Execute the command `dotnet run`, to run this project.
5. Keep this application running in that terminal.

### B. Front-end

1. Open the another integrated terminal (keep the terminal open, where your backend project is running).
2. Execute the command `npm i` to install all the dependencies.
3. Execute `ng serve --open` to run and open this project in browser.

## Are you facing problems on migrations?

You might get error while executing them from CLI, because we have multiple projects.

Error might be:

```txt
```

Visit to the root directory of backend project, which named `backend` in our case. So visit to `backend` directory and execute these commands in a sequece:

Creating migration:

```sh
dotnet ef migrations add SomeMigration --project InventoryMgt.Data --startup-project InventoryMgt.Api
```

Note: You need to replace `SomeMigration` to a meaningful name


However, this project can apply migration while you run it. But, in case you manually want to run it. Update database: 

```sh
dotnet ef database update --project InventoryMgt.Data --startup-project InventoryMgt.Api
```
